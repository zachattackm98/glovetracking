Review my Supabase SQL schema and RLS policies to ensure they are fully compatible with the following Clerk JWT claims:

{
  "org_id": "{{organization.id}}",
  "user_id": "{{user.id}}",
  "org_role": "{{organization.role}}",
  "org_slug": "{{organization.slug}}"
}

- All table columns, especially for user and organization references, should use the same names and types as the JWT claims (`org_id`, `user_id`, `org_role`, `org_slug`).
- All RLS policies should reference these claims using `auth.jwt()->>'org_id'`, `auth.jwt()->>'user_id'`, `auth.jwt()->>'org_role'`, and `auth.jwt()->>'org_slug'` as appropriate.
- Please point out any mismatches or improvements needed for full compatibility.
